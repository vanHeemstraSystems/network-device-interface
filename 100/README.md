Based on "The Unofficial Guide to NDI" at [_The Unofficial Guide to NDI - 6 x 9 in.docx (2).pdf](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/network-device-interface/files/10672720/_The.Unofficial.Guide.to.NDI.-.6.x.9.in.docx.2.pdf)

Network Device Interface (NDI®) is a high quality, low latency IP video transmission standard that is popular for video production.

NDI® is an easy way to connect live video sources between computers.

The NDI® video connection standard was initially adopted by the live video production industry for use in software including Wirecast, vMix, LiveStream Studio, OBS (via a plugin), xSplit, and the NewTek
TriCaster. 

Today, NDI® is used in a wide variety of video applications including broadcast, distance learning, and video communications. 

It’s easy to use NDI® with almost any project that uses video on a computer since there are so many software and hardware integrations.
